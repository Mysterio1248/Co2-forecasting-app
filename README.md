# CO₂ Emissions Forecasting Project

### Overview

This project focuses on forecasting CO₂ emissions using a combination of time-series analysis and machine learning models. The primary goal is to predict future CO₂ emissions based on historical data and identify trends to support decision-making for environmental policies and sustainable development.

### Dataset

The dataset includes historical CO₂ emission data with attributes such as:

- Year

- Country/Region

- Emission levels

### Tools and Technologies

- Platform: Kaggle Notebooks

- Programming Language: Python

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, FBProphet

- Modeling Frameworks: ARIMA, Prophet, Regression Models

### Usage

Accessing the Notebook

Visit the Kaggle Notebook.

Fork the notebook to your Kaggle account.

Run the notebook to preprocess the dataset, train models, and visualize forecasts.

### Project Workflow

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and scaling the dataset.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing trends and relationships.

- Model Training: Implementing ARIMA, Prophet, and regression models.

- Evaluation: Comparing model results and selecting the best-performing model.

- Forecasting: Generating future predictions and analyzing trends.

### Results 

- We can clearly see that double exponential smoothing model is performing best among all other models
  
- Try playing with model parameters, try to understand them and tune them and you'll see improvement in your model.

### Future Work

Incorporate more advanced machine learning models such as XGBoost or LSTM.

Enhance dataset by integrating external factors like economic and environmental indicators.
